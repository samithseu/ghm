# GHM - GitHub Mail

### ℹ️ What is this?

I created this little site just to solve one problem which is finding the email address of a GitHub user by `username`.

⚡ Favorite usage: It helps me find `co-author` email for mentioning in a commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "commit message...

Co-authored-by: [Name] <[GitHub-Email]>"
```
